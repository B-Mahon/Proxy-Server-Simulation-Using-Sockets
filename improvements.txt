Things to add next 
- Functionality for client to receive the length of the message first then display the message
    - For both server and client when sending a message:
            1. Send the length of the message first 
            2. Recipieant of message will first read the length of the message and if its correct then read the message 
            3. Message sender will always wait for an acknowledgement of some sort back after sending a message 
    
- Could add pickle to allow for sending any type of data between server and client 

- Could add a security mechanism in for the proxy so the client has to attach a special key or something that the proxy would read first
